<p> The task of this assignment was to create a sketch that uses multiple of the same type of shape to create an "X" stretched across the canvas. Also, an array must be created of different colors. Then the random function must be used to randomize the color of each shape. 
<p> I first used a 2 for(loop)'s to create the X which looked like this: 
  
  ```Javascript
     for (let row2 = 0; row2 < 15; row2++) {
let randomColor = random(myColors)
fill (randomColor)
 rect (xCoord2,yCoord2,recSize)
   xCoord2 = xCoord2 -30.6
     yCoord2 = yCoord2 +31

   } 
  }
```   
                                  
<p> I then used an array which looked like this:
  
```Javascript
    let myColors = ["aliceblue", "blue",
      "cornflowerblue", "darkblue","aqua","darkslateblue",                                 "azure","midnightblue","lightblue"]  
```
